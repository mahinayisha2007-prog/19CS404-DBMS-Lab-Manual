# Experiment 4: Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having Clause

## AIM
To study and implement aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause with suitable examples.

## THEORY

### Aggregate Functions
These perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **MIN()** – Smallest value  
- **MAX()** – Largest value  
- **COUNT()** – Number of rows  
- **SUM()** – Total of values  
- **AVG()** – Average of values

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### GROUP BY
Groups records with the same values in specified columns.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```
### HAVING
Filters the grouped records based on aggregate conditions.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
```

**Question 1**
--
How many appointments are scheduled for each doctor?
```

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM customer
WHERE city!='Noida';
```

**Question 5**
---
Write a SQL query to calculate the average purchase amount of all orders. Return average purchase amount.

Sample table: orders

ord_no      purch_amt   ord_date    customer_id  salesman_id

----------  ----------  ----------  -----------  -----------

70001       150.5       2012-10-05  3005         5002

70009       270.65      2012-09-10  3001         5005

70002       65.26       2012-10-05  3002         5001

```
SELECT AVG(purch_amt) AS AVERAGE
FROM orders;
```

**Output:**

**Question 6**
---
Write a SQL query to determine the number of customers who received at least one grade for their activity.

Sample table: customer

customer_id |   cust_name    |    city    | grade | salesman_id 

-------------+----------------+------------+-------+-------------

        3002 | Nick Rimando   | New York   |   100 |        5001

        3007 | Brad Davis     | New York   |   200 |        5001

        3005 | Graham Zusi    | California |   200 |        5002

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM customer
WHERE grade IS NOT NULL;
```

**Output:**

**Question 7**
---
Write a SQL query to find how many employees have an income greater than 50K?

Table: employee

----------  ----------
id          INTEGER
name        TEXT
age         INTEGER

**Question 8**
---
Write the SQL query that achieves the grouping of data by age intervals using the expression (age/5)5, calculates the total salary sum for each group, and excludes groups where the total salary sum is not greater than 5000.

SELECT (age/5)*5 AS age_group,SUM(salary)
FROM customer1
GROUP BY age_group
HAVING SUM(salary)>5000;
```

**Output:**

<img width="584" height="337" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-27 152829" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71bc3589-f2e2-4bfc-844c-b8af0614ce21" />


**Question 9**
---

SELECT city,AVG(income)
FROM employee
GROUP BY city
HAVING AVG(income)>500000;
```

**Output:**

<img width="573" height="406" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-27 152839" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/808fd86f-8fe0-486b-8ac8-a4d2699d7305" />
